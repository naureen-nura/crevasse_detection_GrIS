Crevasse Detection Using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery on the Greenland Ice Sheet
=============================


This is a model in development to detect crevasses from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery on Greenland. We are using a generic **U-Net** implementation `unet <https://github.com/jakeret/unet>`_ built with Tensorflow 2.
